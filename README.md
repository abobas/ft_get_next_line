# ft_get_next_line

## Project

This is a project for Codam (42 Network). <br>
The assignment consisted of implementing a function which reads from a file descriptor one line at a time. <br>
The function saves the remainder of the line in a static variable.

I finished the project on 11/12/2019 with a grade of 100%.
